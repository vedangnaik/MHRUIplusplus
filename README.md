# MHR User Interface++

Have you ever wished that Monster Hunter Rise's UI was customizable? I mean, do I really need to know my Buddies' health all the time? Why is the quest timer so intrusive? And why can't I increase/decrease the font?? If so, then MHR User Interface++ is the mod for you!

MHR User Interface++ (abbreviated MHRUIpp) replaces MHR's default un-resizable, fixed UI with a set of highly customizable widgets that you can tune to your heart's content. Currently, the mod comes with replacements for the health gauge, the stamina gauge, the debuff indicator, and the quest timer.

And this list is only growing! Planned widgets include:

* A revamped sharpness indicator
* A less-intrusive monster tracker
* Integrated monster health/stamina/status gauges a la 
* [If possible] A more detailed minimap
* [If possible] Weapon-specific UI e.g. custom Charge Blade phials, Longsword gauge, etc.
